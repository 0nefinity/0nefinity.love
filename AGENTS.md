# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is a creative and philosophical project centered on "0nefinity" (the identity $0 \equiv 1 \equiv \infty$). It lacks a traditional formal architecture, instead functioning as a collection of HTML, JavaScript, and Markdown experiments.

- **Entry Points**: [./index.html](./index.html) and [./README.html](./README.html) contain the primary explanations and navigation.
- **Global Assets**: [./meta.js](./meta.js) and [./meta.css](./meta.css) govern the global UI, including the menu system and color schemes.
- **Core Logic**: [./0nefinity.js](./0nefinity.js) is the central script for the 0nefinity theory's manifestations.
- **Tools & Libraries**: Shared utilities and libraries (e.g., [./tools/tools/pixi.js](./tools/tools/pixi.js), [./tools/tools/decimal.js](./tools/tools/decimal.js), [./tools/controls.js](./tools/controls.js)) are located in the [./tools/](./tools/) directory.
- **Archive**: Older versions and raw ideas are kept in [./00_Archiv/](./00_Archiv/).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There is no formal build system (no `npm` or `package.json`).
- **Live Preview**: Development is optimized for **Five Server** (VS Code extension), as evidenced by [./fiveserver.config.js](./fiveserver.config.js).
- **Utility Scripts**: Occasional Python ([./py.py](./py.py), [./errorpages/err.py](./errorpages/err.py)) and PHP ([./tools/generate-structure.php](./tools/generate-structure.php)) scripts are used for content generation or server-side tasks.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
The codebase is informal and experimental. AI agents should adhere to the following rules:
- **Language**: Communication with the user should be in **German**, even if the project uses a hybrid of German and English.
- **0nefinity Philosophy**: Controls and logic should always support `0` as a valid input and strive for "unlimited" ranges (approaching $\infty$).
- **Styling**: Always respect [./meta.css](./meta.css) for colors. The author notes that `meta.css` often uses `!important` to enforce the aesthetic.
- **UI Components**: Use [./meta.js](./meta.js), [./tools/controls.js](./tools/controls.js), and [./tools/zoom.js](./tools/zoom.js) for standard interactions.
- **Efficiency**: Code should remain smooth even on older hardware ("Gurke").
- **Naming**: File names are descriptive, often in German, and may contain spaces or emojis.

## Commit Guidelines
Commit messages are informal and often in German or a mix of German and English (e.g., "zwischenspeichern", "018 ascii animation, yeah"). No specific prefix or format is required, but clarity regarding the "nuggets" or "experiments" added is preferred.
